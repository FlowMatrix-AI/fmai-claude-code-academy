# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-16)

**Core value:** Anyone on the team can learn the full FMAI Claude Code system well enough to use it independently and teach others, without needing to shadow the person who built it.
**Current focus:** Phase 1: Content Foundation & Navigation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 4 (Content Foundation & Navigation)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-02-16 — Roadmap created with 4 phases covering all 34 v1 requirements

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 0
- Average duration: N/A
- Total execution time: 0 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| - | - | - | - |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: N/A
- Trend: Not yet established

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- All key decisions currently pending execution (Web app over CLI, Obsidian vault content source, no auth for v1, localStorage for progress, Next.js + Vercel stack)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Phase 1 readiness considerations (from research):**
- Obsidian markdown transform strategy needs validation with actual FMAI Knowledge Base vault
- Next.js 15 + React 19 stability verification (fallback to 14.x + 18 if unstable)
- Content structure mapping from Obsidian folder hierarchy to course structure

**Known risks:**
- Content staleness as CLI system evolves (requires version metadata system in Phase 1)
- localStorage data loss (requires error handling in Phase 3)
- Quiz design testing memorization vs understanding (requires scenario-based design in Phase 4)

## Resolved Questions

Move questions here once answered. Keep the record for reference.

| # | Original Question | Answer | Answered By | Date Resolved |
|---|-------------------|--------|-------------|---------------|
| 1 | What architecture for the new features? | n8n-centric with GitHub content store. n8n handles all automation, content committed as JSON to GitHub, Vercel auto-deploys. No database. | Dominic + Claude | 2026-02-20 |
| 2 | Which messaging platform for the curation bot? | Telegram. Free bot API, native n8n integration, trivial setup. WhatsApp requires Business API approval and costs per-message. | Dominic | 2026-02-20 |
| 3 | What AI news topics matter most? | Primary: AI tools/products and research/models. Secondary (footer): industry/business news. Focus on what helps the company advance. | Dominic | 2026-02-20 |
| 4 | How should the morning memo be delivered? | Published to Academy "What's New in AI" page with notification. Future: email newsletter for external subscribers. | Dominic | 2026-02-20 |
| 5 | What happens when a link is dropped in the Telegram bot? | AI summarizes + categorizes + stores immediately. Content accumulates throughout the day and appears on Academy. Also bundled into next morning's digest. | Dominic | 2026-02-20 |
| 6 | How are the new features related to the Academy? | Academy is the primary display layer. n8n pipelines feed content into it via GitHub. "What's New" section surfaces all content. Academy also remains the training hub for new hires. | Dominic | 2026-02-20 |
| 7 | How is the Obsidian vault connected? | Currently linked to GitHub. Manual sync for now — separate repos. Will eventually merge into partner's ava/executive dashboard as a git branch. | Dominic | 2026-02-20 |
| 8 | Should new sources be auto-added or manually approved? | Source learning: after 3+ links from the same untracked source, bot asks the group "Add as daily source?" Team approves/rejects. Also supports manual /add command. | Dominic | 2026-02-20 |
| 9 | Is n8n already available? | Yes — partner has n8n Cloud account. Dominic needs access. | Dominic | 2026-02-20 |
| 10 | Content format for news and curated content? | JSON files (not Markdown). Structured data for flexible rendering. One file per day. | Dominic + Claude | 2026-02-20 |
| 11 | How should Instagram/TikTok reels be handled? | Most curated content will be short-form (reels). Use Open Graph metadata + any note the sender includes. Won't be full video transcripts but useful categorized references with original links. | Dominic | 2026-02-20 |
| 12 | What default RSS/web sources for the scraper? | 18+ sources: Hacker News, TechCrunch AI, arXiv, HuggingFace Papers, GitHub Trending, 10+ subreddits (LocalLLaMA, MachineLearning, ClaudeAI, ChatGPT, artificial, AItools, n8n, StableDiffusion, Automate), Anthropic/OpenAI/DeepMind blogs, Product Hunt AI | Claude | 2026-02-20 |
| 13 | meta.json management for course structure? | Manual for now. Updated when adding new lessons. Auto-generation from folder scan is a future enhancement. | Dominic | 2026-02-20 |

## Assumptions

Things we are assuming to be true. Each should be validated or explicitly accepted before the build starts.

| # | Assumption | Status | Validated By | Notes |
|---|-----------|--------|-------------|-------|
| 1 | Existing Academy codebase builds and deploys cleanly | Accepted | Codebase analysis | `npm run build` succeeds, deployed on Vercel |
| 2 | n8n Cloud has sufficient workflow execution limits for daily scraping + bot processing | Unvalidated | | Check n8n Cloud plan limits once access is obtained |
| 3 | Anthropic API key has sufficient quota for quiz + explain + future Ask AI feature | Unvalidated | | Monitor usage; existing quiz/explain features already use it |
| 4 | RSS feeds for AI news sources are stable and publicly accessible | Accepted | Common knowledge | Major sources (HN, arXiv, Reddit) have stable RSS. Individual feeds may change but won't block others. |
| 5 | Telegram Bot API remains free for group message monitoring | Accepted | Telegram docs | Telegram Bot API is free with generous rate limits |
| 6 | GitHub API rate limits won't block daily commits from n8n | Accepted | GitHub docs | 5000 requests/hour for authenticated users; n8n commits ~2-5 per day |
| 7 | Open Graph metadata is sufficient for Instagram/TikTok reel summaries | Accepted | Dominic | Full video transcription out of scope; OG metadata + sender notes is enough for a reference entry |
| 8 | Vercel rebuild time (1-2 minutes) is acceptable for content freshness | Accepted | Dominic | Daily digests and curated items aren't time-critical |
| 9 | Partner will provide n8n Cloud access | Unvalidated | | Verbal agreement, needs action |
| 10 | The deep space theme and existing component patterns are the right visual direction for new pages | Accepted | Dominic | Consistency with existing Academy UI |
| 11 | Two separate repos (Academy + partner's dashboard) remain separate for now | Accepted | Dominic | Future merge as git branch when ready |
| 12 | Claude API can effectively summarize AI news articles in 2-3 sentences with accurate relevance ranking | Accepted | General Claude capability | May need prompt tuning for optimal results |

---

## Blockers

Anything preventing the pre-build package from being finalized.

| # | Blocker | Owner | Status | Resolution |
|---|---------|-------|--------|------------|
| 1 | n8n Cloud access needed from partner | Partner | **OPEN** | Dominic needs to be added to partner's n8n Cloud workspace. Blocks Phase 2 and 3. |
| 2 | Telegram bot token needs creation | Dominic | **OPEN** | Create bot via @BotFather, set up private group. Blocks Phase 3. |
| 3 | Newsletter email service selection | Dominic | **OPEN — LOW PRIORITY** | Phase 4 item. Can defer until Phase 4 planning. |
